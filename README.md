# Blightfall-Untainter

This is a mod that creates an "untainter" item for Blightfall

There is no texture or localized name, as I am lazy and didn't feel like doing it right, though I *might* add that in later if I ever am bored and need something to do.

The vast majority of this code is all Talonos' and Canvox's, you can find the github repo [here](https://github.com/CannibalVox/CavesToKingdoms).

This code is bad, you will get very little if any support from me if there is an issue or you want to add a feature.

It cleans an 11 chunk diameter area, removes Thaumcraft's tainted mobs, and purifies tainted nodes.
